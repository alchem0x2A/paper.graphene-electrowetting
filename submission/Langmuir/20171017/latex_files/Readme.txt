The figure images are in the img/ folder; The latex files are in the
writing/ foler.

The TeX files "manuscript_revised.tex" and
"supporting_information_revised.tex" are used for generating the
revised version (without editing trace) files.

The TeX files "manuscript_revised.tex" and
"supporting_information_revised.tex" will be generated after running
Makefile (requires latexdiff) and compile into the pdf with edit
traces.

Please use the Makefile (by invoking shell command "make") in the
writing/ folder for generating the pdfs, or use xelatex as the latex
compiler.
