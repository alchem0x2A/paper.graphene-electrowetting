\subsection{Explanation for Shift of \(\Delta \Phi_{\mathrm{Coul}}\) Maximum from Charge Neutral State}
\label{sec:orgdeeca1e}

As can be seen in Figure 3(c) in the main text, the maximum of \(\Delta
\Phi_{\mathrm{Coul}}\) as function of \(\sigma_{\mathrm{2D}}\) shifts
from charge neutral state (\(\sigma_{\mathrm{2D}} = 0\)) to slightly
n-doped region. This behavior can be explained by the contribution
from the interfacial charge density to the Coulombic interactions (Figure \ref{fig-SI-mode}(a)).
Assuming that the interfacial charge density per unit area of the
water layer \(\sigma_{\mathrm{L}}\) is approximated by
\(\sigma_{\mathrm{L}}=\delta_{\mathrm{L}} \cdot t_{1}\), where \(t_{1}\)
is the thickness of the 1st water layer (\textasciitilde{}2.8 \AA{}). The interfacial
Coulombic potential caused by the 1st charged layer is then:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:1}
\begin{aligned}
\Phi_{\mathrm{Coul}}^{\mathrm{int}} &= \frac{\sigma_{\mathrm{2D}} \sigma_{\mathrm{L}}}{2C_{\mathrm{int}}} \\
                                           &= \frac{\sigma_{\mathrm{2D}} \delta_{\mathrm{L}} t_{1} d_{1}}{2\epsilon_{\mathrm{int}}}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where \(C_{\mathrm{int}}=\epsilon_{\mathrm{int}}/d_{1}\) is the
geometric capacitance of the interfacial void, \(\epsilon_{1}\) and
\(d_{1}\) are the permittivity and thickness of the interfacial void. We
assume that the interfacial dielectric constant
\(\epsilon_{\mathrm{int}} = 20 \epsilon_{0}\)
\cite{conway_dielectric_1951}, and take the value of \(d_{1}\) from the
value of the most probable charge distribution distance \(z_{1}\) from
Figure \ref{fig-SI-1st}(c). The comparison between the \(\Delta
\Phi_{\mathrm{Coul}}\) from MD results and the proposed model can be
seen in Figure \ref{fig-SI-mode}(b). The degree of Coulombic
interactions from the model is close to that of the MD results,
indicating that the decrease of interaction potential of the
graphene-water system is mainly determined by the interfacial charge
distribution. The result predicted by the model also shows a shifted
maximum of \(\Delta \Phi_{\mathrm{Coul}}\), well corresponding with the
MD results. Such asymmetric behavior is further ascribed to the
decrease of \(\delta_{\mathrm{L}}\) when graphene is slightly n-doped
(see Figure \ref{fig-SI-1st}(d)), as a combined result of the Coulombic
interaction and hydrogen bonding. Note that in the p-doped regime, the
model-predicted \(\Delta \Phi_{\mathrm{Coul}}\) value differs from the
MD results, suggesting that the contribution from the subsequent
layers are important.

(b) Comparison between the \(\Delta \Phi_{\mathrm{Coul}}\) values calculated by MD simulation and the proposed model. The results obtained by the simple capacitance model shows similar shift of \(\Delta \Phi_{\mathrm{2D}}\) maximum.}
